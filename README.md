A boilerplate project to run docker within Virtualbox, with the help of vagrant.

It aims to help Windows users which have difficulties running Docker.

* Install Vagrant


## Usage

Open Git bash (or Powershell) in the project directory, then run

    vagrant up

Once the system is installed, log in onto it by running :

That's all. You are now connected on a linux server.
