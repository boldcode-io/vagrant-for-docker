# Vagrant for docker

A ready-for-work environment to run docker + various programming languages with the help of vagrant (and Virtualbox).

It aims to help Windows users which have difficulties running Docker or Unix tools.

## Prerequisites

* Optional : Install chocolatey
* Install Virtualbox (with `choco install virtualbox`)
* Install Vagrant (with `choco install vagrant`)

## Usage

Open Git bash (or Powershell) in the project directory, then run

    vagrant up

Once the system is installed, log in onto it by running :

    vagrant ssh


That's all. You are now connected on a linux server.
